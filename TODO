Currently doesn't work on:
- homedepot.com [1. finds the credit card offer; 2. total price has no dot anywhere]
- ralphlauren.com, malingoetz.com [traversing the nodes takes too long]
- alexanderwang.com [promo code opens in a different popup]
- hugoboss.com, rmwilliams.com [apply coupon not clickable]
- alecsandermcqueen.com oakley.com bestbuy.com [distance between promo code and prices too big <- this could be a configuration option]
- modcloth.com [apply button is a div with an event handler]
- patagonia [finds subtotal when coupon field is open <- this could be a configuration option, cluster proximity]
- brooksbrothers.com [too much space between the dollar sign and the number for prices <- visibleTexts could have a configuration option]
- meundies.com [the apply coupon node disappears after clicking on it]
- udemy.com [it's popping up and finding the wrong total price on the course page]s

The biggest update to address is store cards. Right now large stores promote
their store cards on the cart page and it confuses the algorithm. The improvement is
looking for 'card' keywords and make sure they are not too close to the priceCluster.

We should find out why it freezes the session on ralphlauren.com.

We could add more error detection strings. Because on a bad coupon the price is the same
it's not that big of a deal.

Right now there are a number of sleep() calls in the code because waiting for pages to load or
redirects and other things is a solved problem and beyond the scope of this project.

Currency detection has to be improved, now it's naively looking for dollar sign.
